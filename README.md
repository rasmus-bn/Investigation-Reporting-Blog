## Initiating problem statement

In a world with a continously rising amout of data it is essential to be able to process the data automatically. Machine learning or "AI" is a great tool for analyzing large amounts of data. However the algorithms are based on math and can not be directly fed with images or text data. The algorithms only understands numbers so in order to use machine learning to process texts or images the data needs to be preprocessed.



(Converting text into feature vectors.)




## Narrowing (What to choose?)

In my machine learning exam project I performed sentiment analysis of workplace reviews created by employees at some of the worlds largest tech companies. The dataset contained text data written by the employee alongside with a rating from 1-5. We had to predict the whether the rating was negative (1-3) or positive (4-5) from the written text and so we needed to transform the data into numbers for our machine learning algorithm to understand. 

### Count vectorization

## Problem statement

Why remove stop words when using tfidf?
Using tfidf with stopwords?
Tfidf vs countvectoriser?

How tfidf works and why we chose to use it?
We chose tfidf but is it better?
